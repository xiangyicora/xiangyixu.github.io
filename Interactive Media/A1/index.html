                <h4>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interact with experience?</h4>

                <p>When I clicked on the site, the first thing that caught my eye was the huge homepage background image and the tagline "Joint Exhibition Ticket Offers". It made me realize that most of the initial information we capture on the site is visual Information, as a first impression, the high-quality pictures of the Bonnard exhibition, which occupies the largest area on the homepage, aroused my interest in clicking in for details.</p>

            <li>

                <h4>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
    
                <p>When interacting with the NGV website, I spend the most time in the "Explore collections by theme" section. Because in this area, I clicked on the topic of feminism that I am interested in, which included the listening and reading sections, which included Dr. Lisa's eight-minute speech and an article about the portrait of Mary Beale. The recording time and article content are very long. Although I just played the audio quickly and skimmed through the articles, this area still took me the longest.</p>

            </li>
            
            <li>

                <h4>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
    
                <p>During the two minutes of the interactive experience, the most common action I do is to continuously scroll the mouse and move down the website page.</p>

            </li>
            
            <li>

                <h4>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
    
                <p>For me, I think the primary goal for this interactive experience is to let me use the website to learn about recent art exhibitions or new events, show if there is interesting content to read further details, book exhibition tickets, and purchase event peripherals through the site. </p>

            </li>

            <li>

                <h4>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h4>

                <p>During the experience, I noticed a lot of pictures of exhibits in different sizes and titles in different bold fonts. For example, the two most important recent large-scale exhibitions are “Bonnard” which was designed by Indian Mahdavi, and “Rembrandt: True to Life.” So at the beginning of the experience, when you open the NGV, you will focus on the huge background image of the exhibition collage and the bold heading “Joint Exhibition Ticket Offer”, and then you will immediately pay attention to the subtitle “ See Pierre Bonnard: Designed by India Mahdavi and Rembrandt: True to Life” for $48”. You know that the joint ticket is only 48 dollars, and the next step you want to click on the picture to learn the specific details of the two latest exhibitions, achieving the original intention of the website. It utilizes visual hierarchy by size, imagery, typography, etc. to establish a focal point, this shows us where the most important information is.</p>

            </li>
            
            <li>

                <h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
    
                <p>For me, two minutes of experience time is not enough for me to browse the entire website, and I may stay on the site for about ten minutes. But it depends on what each person's intention is. If he just wants to click on the website to order the tickets he needs, then two mins is enough. If he wants to know about recent exhibitions like me and read about artworks or artists' information, that would require more interaction time. I think I will return to the NGV regularly each month. Because I know it will be updated with new event content, which is very helpful for me to know about what art exhibitions are going on in the near future.</p>

            <li>

                <h4>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>

                <p>Over time, the website will communicate through regularly updated content and add new information. This will help them keep a steady stream of visitors coming back to their website. Additionally, it fosters connections with potential audiences, who value having access to fresh data on their favorite subjects.</p>

            <li>

                <h4>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>

                <p>When I searched for this reference with other devices, I found that NGV has layouts for mobile and iPad screens. Actually, people nowadays, including myself, are more and more used to browsing websites with mobile phones, so I think it is very important to use a responsive layout to build a web.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

                <h4>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h4>

                <p>When I was experiencing the interaction, I noticed that the webpage contained a lot of call-to-action languages when I was experiencing, such as "see all exhibitions", "see all events", "find out more", 'plan your visit", "book ahead and bring your friend", these slogans clearly tell me what to do next. In addition, I noticed that there is often a simple black arrow next to the title or slogan, which prompts my next action to scroll down the page or expand. At the same time, the clear classification of the navigation bar also guides my next action, when I want to click on the part of interest.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
                
                <h4>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h4>

                <p>When experiencing the reference, I feel it is professional, trustworthy, and artistic. I think there are several reasons why it was able to convey these feelings to me. First of all, its grid-based layout makes the content distribution neat and clean. Its overall visual style is unified, with a unified bold font. This communicates to visitors that this is a professional, aesthetically pleasing website. Secondly, its content is all related to art, and the articles are highly readable and interesting, plus all the high-quality exhibitions/artworks/artist pictures used on the webpage set a visually artistic tone.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

                <h4>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h4>

                <P>The single interaction action makes me feel a bit bored. My whole experience is just scrolling and clicking. I want it could add more engaging forms of interaction.  For example this site: <a href="https://monopo.london/">Monopo London</a>, when I hover over an image it turns into a magnifying glass and changes the content of the image. This interaction makes the site more interesting for me and more enjoyable to interact with.</P>

            </li>

            <li>

                <h4>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h4>

                <p>What I like most about the interactive experience is that I can always quickly and easily find the content that I am looking for or am interested in and not get lost.  I know it due to the reference site having a clean, simple design and intuitive navigation. Website navigation is key to retaining visitors. If the website navigation is confusing visitors will give up and find what they need elsewhere. Keeping navigation simple, intuitive, and consistent on every page is key. Also, its overall visual style is unified, with a unified bold font and a neat and beautiful grid-based layout.</p>
